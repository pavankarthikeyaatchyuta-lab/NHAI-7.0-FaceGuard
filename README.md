# FaceGuard

Secure, lightweight, fully offline facial recognition and liveness detection for NHAI field personnel authentication in remote and zero-network environments.

FaceGuard is built for NHAI Hackathon 7.0 as a practical field authentication system: personnel can enroll, prove liveness, verify identity, and queue audit events without network access. When connectivity returns, encrypted sync events are uploaded to AWS and acknowledged records are purged locally.

## Highlights

- Fully offline authentication path: camera, liveness, embedding, local match, and attendance event queue.
- Lightweight model strategy targeting a total footprint around 20 MB after quantization.
- Challenge-response liveness for blink, smile, and head turns to reduce photo and replay spoofing risk.
- React Native architecture for Android and iOS with native camera, secure storage, and ML runtime adapters.
- Encrypted local identity records, authentication logs, and sync queue.
- AWS S3/DynamoDB sync-and-purge design for Datalake 3.0 ingestion after connectivity returns.
- No unsupported device, APK, model-size, accuracy, or latency claims; metrics remain targets until measured.

## Problem Statement

Develop a secure, lightweight, fully offline facial recognition and liveness detection system for field personnel authentication in remote and zero-network environments.

The solution must support React Native, Android, iOS, low-RAM devices, offline liveness detection, local encrypted storage, and AWS sync-and-purge when connectivity returns.

## Solution Overview

FaceGuard runs the authentication decision on the device:

1. Capture a live face frame burst.
2. Detect and align the primary face.
3. Run challenge-response liveness checks.
4. Generate a lightweight face embedding.
5. Compare against encrypted local identity records.
6. Queue only audit events for later cloud sync.
7. Purge local queue records only after backend acknowledgement.

No benchmark results are claimed in this repository. Accuracy, latency, and model-size values are listed only as target metrics until measured on representative devices.
